I completed a new Blackjack game I worked on from an earlier project. 
I restarted completely and worked through the problems I built in my TODOs folder.

## Game Preview

The game starts by displaying both the Dealers hand and the Players hand.
If the player has an ace the game asks if the player wants to flip the ace with the current hand. If so the ace value is flipped from 11 to 1.
Next the game asks if the player wants to hit or stay. 
* If the player hits and continues to do so, this process repeats until the player wins or busts.
* If the player stays, the dealer plays out the final hand

Checks are made to determine whether the dealer will but, win, draw, or lose.

At the end both hands are displayed, the winner declared, and a question asked "Would you like to play again?"
